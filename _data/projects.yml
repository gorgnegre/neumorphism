- name: MSc Thesis by G. Navarro - Visualization and analysis of the industrial waste categories in Catalonia
  descr: "This work provides visual information regarding the generation and management of the industrial waste to facilitate the application of policies or business models that contribute to a better management of such waste. The data used are part of the 2018 Annual Industrial Waste Declaration, provided by the Agència de Residus de Catalunya (ARC)."

- name: MSc Thesis by C. Luizaga - Sustainability Analysis in Bolivia from Satellite Night Images
  descr: "Satellite images are used to analyze the social, economic and environmental factors of  sustainability in Bolivia. The night-time satellite images ( (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, VIIRS) are used to analyze the distribution of the population, correlating it with energy consumption, environmental degradation and pollution by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and social aspects that are obtained from secondary information sources."

- name: Detection of irrigation inhomogeneities in an olive grove using the NDRE vegetation index obtained from UAV images
  descr: "We have developed a simple photogrammetric method to identify heterogeneous areas of irrigated olive groves and vineyard crops using a commercial multispectral camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). By comparing NDVI, GNDVI, SAVI, and NDRE vegetation indices, we find that the latter shows irrigation irregularities in an olive grove not discernible with the other indices. This may render the NDRE as particularly useful to identify growth inhomogeneities in crops. Given the fact that few satellite detectors are sensible in the red-edge (RE) band and none with the spatial resolution offered by UAVs, this finding has the potential of turning UAVs into a local farmer’s favourite aid tool."
