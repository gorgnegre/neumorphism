- name: Detection of irrigation inhomogeneities in an olive grove using the NDRE vegetation index obtained from UAV images
  descr: "We have developed a simple photogrammetric method to identify heterogeneous areas of irrigated olive groves and vineyard crops using a commercial multispectral camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). By comparing NDVI, GNDVI, SAVI, and NDRE vegetation indices, we find that the latter shows irrigation irregularities in an olive grove not discernible with the other indices. This may render the NDRE as particularly useful to identify growth inhomogeneities in crops. Given the fact that few satellite detectors are sensible in the red-edge (RE) band and none with the spatial resolution offered by UAVs, this finding has the potential of turning UAVs into a local farmer’s favourite aid tool."

- name: Parametrization of Land Uses in the Andean Páramo through Remote Sensing, Organic Carbon Distribution and Non-Parametric Classification Methods
  descr: "Paramo ecosystems are areas of high natural interest as they contribute to water regulation, carbon retention, and possess significant biodiversity. The objective of this study is to develop an effective, economical, and easy to update methodology that allows simple monitoring of its conservation status, rate of degradation, and changes in land use at all times with the aim of, helping to take adequate measures to protect the high Andean tropical moors."

- name: Super Massive Black Hole Accretion Activity
  descr: "Just four decades ago, astronomers thought black holes —regions of intense gravity from which no information can escape— were mathematical oddities. But now astronomers, armed with large multiwavelength telescopes, infer the presence of supermassive black holes in the cores of most medium to large galaxies.  They are the driving engines of quasars, which are highly energetic objects seen in the most distant galaxies.  How quasars are related to star and galaxy formation is one of the most pressing cosmological questions and the one we try to dilucidate."

  descr: "This work provides visual information regarding the generation and management of the industrial waste to facilitate the application of policies or business models that contribute to a better management of such waste. The data used are part of the 2018 Annual Industrial Waste Declaration, provided by the Agència de Residus de Catalunya (ARC)."

- name: MSc Thesis by C. Luizaga - Sustainability Analysis in Bolivia from Satellite Night Images
  descr: "Satellite images are used to analyze the social, economic and environmental factors of  sustainability in Bolivia. Night-time Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) images are used to trace the distribution of the population, and we correlate artificial light with energy consumption, environmental degradation and pollution by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and social aspects that are obtained from secondary information sources."
